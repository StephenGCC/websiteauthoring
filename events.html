        Our Shop has hosted many events in the past. Each with an exciting new twist in the world of Video Games. In 2019, we hosted an Arcade themed competitive event where gamers from across the UK would come to compete in an Arcade Game knock-out competition for a cash prize.

        We have a few events coming up towards the end of 2022. Our next event will be on October 29th 2022 and will go from 4pm-8pm. It will be a costume event where you can cosplay your favorite video game character. There will be three cash prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. This will be mainly focused on being a social event, so we will provide some food and drinks and you will be able to buy alcohol during the event hours. We hope to see you there!
